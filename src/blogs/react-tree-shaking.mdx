Want to make your React app **SUPER SLIM**? Tree shaking is the way to go!

## What is Tree Shaking? 

Tree shaking is a term used in JavaScript bundlers like Webpack and Rollup. It basically means:

- Removing **unused code** from your bundle
- Leaving only the code your app **actually uses**

This helps make your bundles *way smaller*! 💪


## When Should You Tree Shake?

Anytime you want to:

- Reduce your app's **initial load time**
- Make your app as **lightweight as possible**

Some good times to tree shake are:

- When deploying your React app to *production*
- For npm packages to make them *tiny*

## How to Tree Shake

Here's how you enable tree shaking in a React app:

- Import modules using `import`:
```jsx
import React from 'react' 
```

- Bundle your app with Webpack or Rollup. They support tree shaking!

- Configure tree shaking in your bundler:
```jsx
// Webpack 
optimization: {
  usedExports: true
}
```

- Only `import` what you *actually* use:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
```

Not:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
```

- Without babel-preset-env configured to leave ES6 modules, CommonJS code won't be tree shaken.

```jsx
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "modules": false
    }]
  ]
}
```

- Make sure dependencies support tree shaking too!

That's it, now shake that tree! 🎄

## See it in Action

Let's look at an example app *with* and *without* tree shaking:


```jsx
// Without Tree Shaking
import * as react from 'react'
// Bundle 500KB
```

```jsx
// With Tree Shaking
import { useState } from 'react'
// Bundle 120KB 
```


Tree shaking reduced the bundle size by **380KB**! 🤯

As your app grows, tree shaking will *really* start to pay off. So go shake some trees and watch your React bundle size get:  

- Slimmed 🏋️‍♂️
- Trimmed 💇
- Optimized 💡    
- Faster to load 🚀

By tree slicing away the fat! 🥭🥭🥭
