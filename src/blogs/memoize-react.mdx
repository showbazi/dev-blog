When front-end developers decides to optimize there react Application, they often stumble on various different things in which **MEMOIZATION** is one of the most popular one and on looking more deeper in memoization in React we may find the keywords like **React.memo, useCallback, useMemo** etc. Some might feel like alienated by seeing those and some misinterpret it with the **Memoization**(traditional) and often get confused that when to use it, where should we use it or should we use it or not.

But worry not! I was also one of you, but with time I got better and now have a fair bit of idea that how it works behind the scenes and where should we use it and where should we not.

This article will help you on the Memoization in React and help you to move a step further towards becoming a better React developer.

### What is Memoization(Traditional)

> _In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts, such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing._
